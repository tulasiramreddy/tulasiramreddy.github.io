**Timings:** Saturdays 2:00pm - 4:00pm, with a short break.

**Teaching Assistant:** Ajit Mahata (IISER Pune), Shashank Roy (ICTS-TIFR Bengaluru).

**TA session:**

**Course meeting venue:** Meeting link will be posted soon.

**Syllabus:**  Stationarity, White Noise, Auto-correlations, Seasonality; Tests for stationarity, Auto Regression (AR), Moving Average (MA); ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMA models; Exponential Smoothing; G/ARCH models; Anamoly detection, Multivariate Time Series Models, Neural Network Models.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the following concepts is expected. Calculus, Statistics (Linear Regression, Estimation, MLE, Hypothesis Testing), Probability (Random Variables, Properties of normal distribution and other named distributions.) Coding (any language or software, preferably R/Python, should be able to implement concepts on the own).

**Grading:** Continous assessment (50%, includes assignments, class tests and mid-semester examination), End semester(50%)
