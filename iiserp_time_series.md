Further topics (will be covered depending on the time): Hidden Markov Models, Kalman Filtering, Spectral Analysis, Granger Causality, Functional Time Series.



**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the following concepts is expected. Calculus, Statistics (Linear Regression, Estimation, MLE, Hypothesis Testing), Probability (Random Variables, Properties of normal distribution and other named distributions.) Coding (any language or software, preferably R/Python, should be able to implement concepts on the own).

**Grading:** Continuous assessment (50%, includes assignments, class tests and mid-semester examination), End semester(50%)
