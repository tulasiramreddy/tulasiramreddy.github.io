**Course:** Econometrics of Panel Data

**Lecture Hall:**

**Instructor:** Tulasi Ram Reddy (tulasi 'dot' math 'at' gmail 'dot' com)

**Office Hours:**

**Topics covered:** OLS Regression, Generalized OLS, One way fixed and random effects model, Two way fixed and random effects model, Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), Dynamic SUR, Instrumental Variables, 2SLS Estimators, M-Estimation, Genaralised Method of Moments (GMM), System GMM, Asymptotic Theory, (if time permits, we will cover some Machine Learning aspects of panel data).


**Pre-requisites:** Familiarity with basic statistical concepts such as estimation techniques, hypothesis testing, and probability distributions. 
Exposure to regression analysis, including simple linear regression and multiple regression, is essential.
Understanding of Linear algebra and multivariate calculus (derivatives and integrals) (derivatives and integrals) is necessary.
