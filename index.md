## Tulasi Ram Reddy

I was a postdoctoral associate at New York University, Abu Dhabi hosted by Federico Camia. I also had a brief stint as a postdoctoral visiting scientist at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore center hosted by Siva Athreya. Prior to this, I obtained PhD in Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore under the supervision of Manjunath Krishnapur. Earlier, I obtained Bachelors in Statistics (Hons.) and Masters in Statistics degrees at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
